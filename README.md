# New Tab Page

Build a static, dark themed "New Tab" page based on a simple json file.

It creates a simple static html file with sections and linked icons based on
the provided structure in the json input.

Take a look at `example.json`, which covers all available structures. It is
ready to build and can be built with the make target `build-example`.

Call the Python script like this:

```
python create.py <input_file>
```
